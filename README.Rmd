### Assignment 1

## Hello Octocat

I love Octocat. She's the coolest cat in town.

### Assignment 2

###### Quick look
```{r quick look, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Load data
data("anscombe")
# Dimensions
dim(anscombe)
# Column names
names(anscombe)
# First and last 6 lines of data
head(anscombe, n=6)
tail(anscombe, n=6)
# Summary statistics
summary(anscombe)
```

### Assignment 3

###### XY Plot
```{r xy_plot, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=8, fig.width=8, fig.path= './figures/', dev='svg'}
data("anscombe")
# Scatterplot
plot(anscombe$x1, anscombe$y1)
# Add abline showing linear regression
abline(lm(y1 ~ x1, data = anscombe))
```

### Assignment 4

###### Importing data
```{r data_import, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
#Use readr package to read data from url and store dataframe into object called 'df'.
df <- readr::read_csv('https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/analgesic.csv')
```

###### Summarising a dataset
```{r data_summary, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Dimensions 
dim(df)
# Names of columns
names(df)
# First and last 6 lines of data
head(df, n=6)
tail(df, n=6)
# Summary statistics
summary(df)
```

###### Tidying data
```{r data_tidy, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
# Tidy data from wide to long format
gathered <- gather(df, key = Measurement, value = Value, Measurement_1:Measurement_3)
# Summarize data by calculating mean across the measurements for each individual
summary <- summarise(group_by(gathered, ID), mean(Value))
# Print final data frame
print(summary)
```


### Chicken weights

**Null hypothesis:** There is no difference in weight of chickens on different feeds.

**Alternative hypothesis:** Different feeds result in differences in chicken weights.

```{r chicken_weights, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
# Import data
chicks <- readr::read_csv('https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/chick-weights.csv?dl=1')
sum
# Plot data
boxplot(weight~feed, data = chicks)
# Run statistical test
anova <- aov(weight~feed, data = chicks)
summary(anova)
# Perform post-hoc test to correct for multiple comparisons
pairwise.t.test(chicks$weight, chicks$feed, p.adjust.method = 'holm', paired = FALSE)
```
Statistical test: One-way ANOVA
Post-hoc test: Holm's multiple comparison test

Assumptions that underlie test:

* Data are normally distributed.
* Equal variance across groups.
* The errors are independent.
* Data are unmatched.

Test statistic: F-value = 15.37

Degrees of freedom: 5

p value: p < 0.05

**Conclusion:** The different feeds had  significant effect on weight of chickens (F = 15.37). The weight of chickens fed casein feed was higher than the weight of chickens fed horsebean (p = 2.9e-08), linseed (p = 0.00016) and soybean (p = 0.00532) feeds. The difference in weight between chickens fed casein feed was not significantly different from the weight of chickens fed meatmeal (p = 0.18227) and sunflower (p = 0.81249) feeds. We can therefore reject the null hypothesis because there are differences in the weight of chickens fed different feeds.


### Hot Zone

**Null hypothesis:** Water consumption has no effect on the prevalence of gastroenteritis.

**Alternative hypothesis:** The prevalence of gastroenteritis is affected by the amount of water consumed.

```{r hot_zone, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
# Import data
hot <- readr::read_csv('https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/gastroenteritis.csv?dl=1')
# Explore data
head(hot)
tail(hot)
# Cross tabulate the data into contingency table
tab <- table(hot$Consumption, hot$Outcome)
# Plot data
barplot(tab, beside = TRUE, legend.text = TRUE, ylim = c(0, 300), col = c('aquamarine', 'blueviolet', 'gold'))
# Statistical test
tab_1 <- tab[-3,]
tab_1p <- fisher.test(tab_1)$p.value
tab_1p
tab_2 <- tab[-2,]
tab_2p <- fisher.test(tab_2)$p.value
tab_2p
tab_3 <- tab[-1,]
tab_3p <- fisher.test(tab_3)$p.value
tab_3p
# Adjust p-values 
p.adjust(c(tab_1p, tab_2p, tab_3p), method = 'holm')
tab
```

Statistical test: Fisher's Exact test

Assumptions:

* Random sampling
* Observations are independent
* Large sample, with adequate expected cell counts

p value: p < 0.05

**Conclusion:** The result show that water consumption has a significant effect on disease outcome. The proportion of people who fell ill after consuming less than 1 glass of water per day is significantly different from the proportion of people who fell ill after consuming 1 to 4 glasses per day (p = 5.167e-09) and more than 4 glasses per day (p = 2.705e-05). We can therefore reject the null hypothesis because there is an effect of water consumption on the number of people who fell ill. 


### Nausea

**Null hypothesis:** There is no difference in nausea intensity score before and after receiving 5HT3-receptor blocker.

**Alternative hypothesis:** The nausea intensity score is decreased after administration of 5HT3-receptor blocker.

```{r nausea, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(vcdExtra)
# Import data
nausea <- readr::read_csv('https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11805474/painblogr/biostats/assignments/nausea.csv?dl=1')
# Exclude outlier
nausea_new <- nausea[-8, -1]
# Summarise data
summary(nausea_new)
# Plot data
boxplot(nausea_new)
# Run statistical test
wilcox.test(nausea_new$Nausea_before, nausea_new$Nausea_after, paired = TRUE)
```

Statistical test: Wilcoxon signed-rank test

Assumptions for non-parametric tests:

* The errors are inependent.
* Samples are drawn from populations with the same shape distributions.
* Matching is effective.

Test statistic: V = 26

Degrees of freedom: 6

p value: p = 0.04983

**Conclusion:** The median of nausea rating before is 4 while the median for nausea rating after is 1. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test shows that there is a significant effect of group (V = 26, p = 0.04983). We can therefore accept the null hypothesis that there is a difference in nausea intensity rating and, by looking at the data, we confirm that the difference is a decrease in the nausea rating.
